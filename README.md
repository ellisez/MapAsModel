# MapAsModel
MapAsModel as its name suggests. Implement various Model objects using Map, such as Entity, VO, and DTO.    Its core idea is to use Map as storage and getter/setter as facade to control visibility.    In order to reduce the cost of object conversion, and even share the same instance, only with different visibility.
